# Drugs-Effects-Project

This project explores the relationships between drugs, their side effects, and the medical conditions they treat. The dataset contains detailed information about various drugs, including their generic and brand names, drug classes, user ratings, and more. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the data.
